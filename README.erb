SYNOPSIS
  fattr.rb is a "fatter attr" for ruby.

  fattr.rb supercedes attributes.rb as that library, even though it added only
  one method to the global namespace, collided too frequently with user code -
  in particular rails' code.

  the implementation of fattr.rb borrows many of the best ideas from the
  metakoans.rb ruby quiz

    http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz67.html

  in particular the solutions of Christian Neukirchen and Florian Gross along
  with concepts from the original traits.rb lib

  key features provided by fattrs are

    - ability to specify default values for attrs and definition time.  values
      can be literal objects or blocks, which are evaluated in the context of
      self to initialize the variable

    - classes remember which fattrs they've defined and this information is
     available to client code

    - a whole suite of methods is defined by calls to #fattrs including
     getter, setter, query (var?) and banger (var! - which forces
     re-initialization from the default value/block)

    - ability to define multiple fattrs at once using key => value pairs

    - fast lookup of whether or not a class has defined a certain fattr

    - fattrs can be defined on objects on a per singleton basis

    - getters acts as setters if an argument is given to them

    - block caching, calling an fattr with a block sets the instance
      variable to that block

    - shortcuts for adding class/module level fattrs

HISTORY
  1.1.0:
    ruby19 testing.  move to github.

  1.0.2:
    added Fattr shortcut for adding class/module level fattrs

      class C
        Fattr 'children' => []

        def C.inherited other
          (children << other).uniq!
          super
        end
      end

      class B < C
      end

      p C.children #=> B

  1.0.0:
    port from attributes.rb retaining all the same features of that version of
    attributes.rb
